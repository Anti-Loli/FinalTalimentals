  dialogue:
  - I see you have begun the final test my young ranger.
  - Oh the door to escape this pocket dimension is on the other side of the cave.
  - 'Sneak past all of the wild talimentals in this cave to pass phase one of the
    test. '
  - This trial is to test your abilites to avoid uneeded battles, if you battle you
    must restart.
  - In case battle cannot be avoided, and that Gusto isn't you partner. So he won't
    appear in your party menu.
  - It won't.
  playerDialogue:
  - Where'd the door go!
  - So what do I have to do?
  - Why do I have to sneak?
  - Why do I have a talimental now?
  - This'll be easy.
